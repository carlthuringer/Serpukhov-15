Serpukhov-15
============

*Serpukhov-15* is a tic-tac-toe game inspired by the 1983 movie *Wargames* and set in Soviet Russia.

You are lieutenant colonel Stanislav Petrov with the Soviet Air Defence Forces. You are the commanding officer at the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) command and control post.
Your job is to give orders should the satellite detection system Oko identify any incoming ballistic missiles.
Besides that, you are at your leisure! 

Gameplay
--------
Enjoy the atmosphere of late 1983 at a Russian monitoring facility simulated in rich 80-character wide high-fidelity terminal monospace lettering. Don't adjust your monitor, we haven't had text this crisp since your parents gathered around CRT screens or teletypes anxiously awaiting the CHNK-CHNK-CHNK to tell them whether 'quaff ye flask' was the right decision."

And you'll have tough decisions to make as well. What -if- the Americans choose tonight to make their strike. It is your responsibility to push that big red button and send greedy Americans and comrades alike into world savaged by nuclear holocaust. 

In the meantime, you can press "Enter" repeatedly to refresh the screen, or play tic-tac-toe against BIGMAC, the Soviet supercomputer that may have been made in America, but has a heart as red as his glowing, all-seeing photoreceptor.

Design Notes
------------
A week before starting this project I had never programmed a lick of Ruby. And now, well, I've used nearly every basic concept in the book. The game isn't done by far, I still want to add a lot of incidental dialog for BIGMAC to say to the player between turns. Also, there is a 'win' condition for the game. Not tic-tac-toe, it's impossible to beat BIGMAC, but the plight of Lt. Col. Petrov. 

The 'game' would be mostly psychological. The player must ignore the warning of incoming nuclear missiles for 15 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take for the missiles to rise over the horizon and become visible to radar and telescope.

The goal would be to place players in the shoes of Stanislav Petrov for the terrifying 15 minutes of waiting. With nothing to do but play tic-tac-toe against a computer that wonders about your sanity, motives, trust in technology, and so on. All delivered via the medium of clever, intermittent dialogue.

If players hit the emergency line before the time is up, then the game is over, everybody is mutually destroyed.

Oh, and there are some jokes. Can you spot them all?
