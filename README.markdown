Serpukhov-15
============

Serpukhov-15 is a tic-tac-toe game inspired by the 1983 movie Wargames and set in Soviet Russia.
You are lieutenant colonel Stanislav Petrov with the Soviet Air Defence Forces.
The early warning systems that you are monitoring are tracking one American ICBM in flight.
You believe this is a bug in Oko, the system, and to test its routines, you will play Noughts and Crosses against the computer.
